# Butterfield

A Slack bot framework using Slack's [Real Time Messaging API](https://api.slack.com/rtm), Python 3 and [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html).

**Butterfield is unstable and being actively developed. Breaking changes will occur.**

## Echo bot example

This simple bot will listen for *message* events and echo the message to the same channel. 

	import asyncio
	from butterfield import Bot
	
	@asyncio.coroutine
	def echo(bot, msg):
		yield from bot.post(
			msg['channel'],
			msg['text']
		)
	
	b = Bot('slack-bot-key')
	b.listen('message', echo)
	b.start()

## Usage

### Receiving Slack events

Bots are created by instantiating an instance with a [Slack bot user](https://api.slack.com/bot-users) key.

	mybot = Bot('this-is-not-a-real-key')
	
Message handlers are asyncio [coroutines](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#coroutine). When executed, they receive the bot instance that invoked the handler and a copy of the event message from Slack.

	@asyncio.coroutine
	def console_printer(bot, message):
		if 'text' in message:
			print(message['text'])

Handlers are registered with the bot using the *listen* method. The first argument is the event type for which the handler will be called. The full list of event types can be found in the [RTM API docs](https://api.slack.com/rtm). The handler can be called for all events by using `"*"` or `butterfield.ALL`. Multiple events can be specified by using a comma seperated string of types: `"channel_joined,channel_left"`.

	mybot.listen('message', console_printer)

The handler parameter can be either a direct reference to the coroutine or the module path as a string.

Now just start the bot and it'll run... FOREVER.

	mybot.start()

### Posting to Slack

Handlers can post messages back to Slack using the *post* method on the bot that was passed to it. The first parameter is the id of the channel that will receive the post. The second parameter is the message that will be posted.

	bot.post(channel_id, 'Hi, channel!')

## TODO

* Add HTTP API so messages can be pushed through Butterfield to Slack.
* Listen for meta events and modify local Slack environment appropriately (list of channels, users, etc.).
* EVERYTHING ELSE!
